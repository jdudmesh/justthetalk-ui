# JUSTtheTalk - UI

This is the UI component of the JUSTtheTalk Discussion Forum. It is written using React/NextJS/Redux with Cypress for testing.

## Current Status
The application is more or less feature complete but it's just a first pass. There are some admin features still under active development. A beta version is running on https://beta.justthetalk.com.

There is much refactoring to be done. Components need breaking down into smaller components and custom hooks and the file layout needs to be better. 

If I was writing this today I'd do the following:
* Rewrite in Typescript
* Ditch Redux in favour of React Query
* Maybe use Tailwind
* Think about tRPC or GraphQL

Test coverage needs to be improved.
